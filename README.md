## Introduction
ComputerVisionTutorials.jl is a Julia package focused on deep learning for computer vision. This package is designed to provide a hands-on approach to learning state-of-the-art vision models and techniques through interactive Pluto notebooks. This package takes full advantage of the Glass Notebook system to provide meta-documentation. This means that each tutorial is not only a standalone guide but also part of a larger, interconnected web of resources. This allows for a more holistic and interconnected learning experience.

*Note: This package integrates several Git submodules like Losers.jl, DistanceTransforms.jl, and ComputerVisionMetrics.jl, all documented within the Glass Notebook system, ensuring seamless integration into the larger documentation framework.*

## Getting Started

## Contribution
We're open to contributions! Feel free to start the coming-soon notebooks, help out with the notebooks that are still in progress, or suggest and create new ones. We accept both pull requests and issues. Our core packages, like Losers.jl and ComputerVisionMetrics.jl, could also use many updates and additions. If you've got a Julia package that's useful for deep learning in computer vision, consider using [Glass Notebook](https://glassnotebook.io/) for your packages documentation and we'd be happy to integrate it directly into ComputerVisionTutorials.jl!
